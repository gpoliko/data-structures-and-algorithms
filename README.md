# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms
My aim is to implement popular data structures and algorithms using the JavaScript programming language. I am on a never-ending learning journey and essentially "sharping the saw". I will also endeavor to provide documentation for each data structure and algorithm, as well as practicing the use of JSDoc.

## Data Structures
A **data structure** is data organisation, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. Specifically, a **data structure** is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Algorithms
An **algorithm** is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions which solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
